How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When I write programs, I try to ensure I make them as modular and expandable as possible. When creating the CRUD program, I made sure it could be expanded on with more methods at any point to expand its functionality. This meant the program could have a longer life span and be more adaptable for use for different scenarios.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When I approached this problem I broke down the development into stages so I could work on each part of the problem until I built the solution. I think I created the database by using MongoDB to help me manage the data. This approach was more precise with me having to create a functional UI for the user compared to my other projects which were more basic.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists help automate tasks at a large scale for companies which helps bring down the man hours needed and the cost of developing products. This is possible because software they build can automate tasks that would previously take many hours of labor. This can drive up profits for companies like Grazioso Salvare and improve their efficiency.
